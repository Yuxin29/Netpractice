# Net Practice – 42 Project

Net Practice is a project for learning network programming in C.
It focuses on creating simple client-server applications, understanding sockets, and handling network communication using TCP/UDP protocols.

## What I learned from this project.
- Implement client and server programs using sockets.
- Learn TCP/UDP communication, connection handling, and message passing.
- Understand network byte order, blocking/non-blocking I/O, and error handling.
